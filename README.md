## Module 15 Bike Sharing

### Project Overview
A proprosal for a Des Moine bikesharing program needs data visualized to make an informed decision whether or not to move forward. Using Pandas and Python as well as Tableau to create visualization for investors.

#### Result Visualzations
  1. Checkout Time for Users chart
  2. Checkout Times by Gender chart
  3. Trips by Weekday Per Hour
  4. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
  5. Gender Breakdown pie chart
  6. August Peak Hours
  7. Bike Repairs
  

  
  
  #### Summary
 With data this large, the parameters are still limited. From what we can see here there is a large interest in male subscribers for the area this data was collected. As well as the peak riding hours being 6-8 am or 6-8 pm. There would need to be more data collected and further analyzed to ensure such a program would be successful in Des Moine.
